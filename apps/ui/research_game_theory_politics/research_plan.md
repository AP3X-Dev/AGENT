# Research Plan: Game Theory in Modern Politics

## Main Research Question
How is game theory applied and used in modern political systems, strategies, and decision-making?

## Subtopics to Investigate

### 1. Core Game Theory Concepts in Political Strategy
- **Expected Information**: Key game theory concepts (Nash equilibrium, prisoner's dilemma, signaling, brinkmanship) and their direct applications to political decision-making
- **How to Synthesize**: Establish foundational concepts that will be referenced in other subtopics

### 2. Historical Case Studies of Game Theory in Politics
- **Expected Information**: Well-documented historical examples where game theory principles were applied or observed in political contexts (Cold War deterrence, arms races, voting systems)
- **How to Synthesize**: Provide concrete examples that illustrate theoretical concepts

### 3. Modern Applications and Digital Age Politics
- **Expected Information**: How game theory is used in contemporary politics, including campaign strategy, legislative bargaining, international negotiations, and social media manipulation
- **How to Synthesize**: Show evolution and current relevance

### 4. Limitations, Criticisms, and Alternative Models
- **Expected Information**: Where game theory falls short in predicting political behavior, critiques from political scientists, and alternative frameworks
- **How to Synthesize**: Provide balanced view and acknowledge boundaries

## Synthesis Approach
1. Establish theoretical foundations from subtopic 1
2. Support with historical examples from subtopic 2
3. Show modern relevance with subtopic 3
4. Address limitations and provide nuanced conclusions from subtopic 4
5. Identify gaps or areas needing further research
